#### Biography

Mike grew up in the small dairy community of Rochester, Victoria, Australia. He spent his summers shovelling rocks and driving 32 tonne trucks at the quarry his father managed - he found out in later life that the former task was deliberately assigned to him by his father to show him what Mike would end up doing in life if he didn't apply himself. He took the hint.

Mike spent the first five years of his software development career in open rebellion, attempting to become a professional actor and musician at various turns. He soon realized that these dreams were not meant to be, and so he focused his efforts on becoming the best developer he could be. After fifteen years of software development, he decided to try something different, and so signed up to do a Masters of Business Administration at Melbourne Business School part-time. He was only a few months out of business school when Trike Apps came a-calling.

Mike worked as the General Manager of Trike Apps for just short of four years. At that time, Bellroy was Trike's biggest client, so much so that the management of both companies agreed to merge TrikeApps into Bellroy and make the Trike team Bellroy's Tech Team. From there, we've never looked back.

When he's not working, Mike likes to spend time outdoors with his family. He especially enjoys camping and doesn't do it nearly often enough. Mike has travelled the world extensively (he's spent at least a week in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan, Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, UAE, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, USA, Canada, Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Croatia and Turkey) and still wishes he could do more travel. He still plays guitar a lot, piano a bit, bass not often enough, and drums more than his talent dictates he should.
